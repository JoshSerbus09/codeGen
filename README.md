This project was written for CS536 - Introduction to Programming Languages and Compilers at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.

6 Parts to the Compiler:

1. Symbol Table
2. Scanner
3. Parser
4. Name Analyzer
5. Type Checker
6. Code Generator

It was a huge pain in the ass to build, but we're glad we did it.

How to run the compiler:

**Preliminary** You must have a Java Cup environment to run the compiler <br />

1. Run the makefile by typing 'make'
  The makefile generates and compiles necessary files.
  <br />
2. Run 'java P6 [arg1] [arg2]' <br />
  arg1: the .txt file containing your Mini code to be compiled <br />
  arg2: the output file <br />
    **Important** do not include an extension on the file because .s will be added 
3. Run 'sim354 -file <filename>'
  The filename will be the .s file generated by step 2.
